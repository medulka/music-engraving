Digitalization of harp scores. Dedicated to the Czech, German, ... world harp communities.

The ephemeric beauty of harp sounds inspirated me to establish the GitHub repositorium music-engraving. The repository contains digitalized harp music compiled by the program Lilypond. 

I have been playing the harp as an amateur. During my neverending searches of nice music pieces to practice, I encountered thousands of copy-of-copies harp scored vividly circulating around the harp community. Once, I was given a copy-of-copy of hand-written scores from F.X. Thuri with several layers of hand-written personal notes from harpists, the owners of previous copy-of-copies. That was the point when I decided to make a change. It was the first digitalized piece. I live with a hope that I saved a precious original from The Maestro for next generation of harpists.
