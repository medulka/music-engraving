**Digitalization of harp scores.**
***Dedicated to world harp communities.***

*Aim:*
The ephemeric beauty of harp sounds inspired the creation of GitHub repositorium *medulka/music-engraving*. The repository contains digitalized harp music written in the program Lilypond. 

*Motivation:*
I have been playing the harp as a hobby for more than fifteen years. I am on a constant search for nice music pieces to practice. I have encountered thousands of copies-of-copies of harp scores vividly circulating in the harp community. Once, I was given a copy-of-copy of a hand-written piece composed by F.X. Thuri. The original scores were decorated with several layers of personal notes from other harpists, the owners of previous copy-of-copies of the music sheet. That was the point when I decided to make a change to the harp world. I sit down and transcripted the Thuri's Intrada into the Lilypond's code, the first digitalized piece of this repositorium was born. I have lived with a hope that I saved a precious original piece from The Maestro Thuri for the next generations of harpists. The repository is intended to grow on the demand.
