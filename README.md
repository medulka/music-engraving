## **Music Engraving**

**Digitalization of scores for harp players. Dedicated to world harp communities.**

*Aim:*
The ephemeric beauty of harp sounds inspired the creation of GitHub repositorium *medulka/music-engraving*. The repository contains digitalized harp music compiled by the program Lilypond. 

*Motivation:*
I have been playing the harp as an amateur for more than fifteen years. I am on a constant search for nice music pieces to practice. I have encountered thousands of copies-of-copies harp scores vividly circulating around the harp community. Once, I was given a copy-of-copy of a hand-written piece composed by F.X. Thuri. The original scores were decorated with several layers of hand-written personal notes from other harpists, the owners of previous copy-of-copies of the music sheet. That was the point when I decided to make a change. I transcripted the Thuri's Intrada into the Lilypond's code, the first digitalized piece of this repositorium. I live with a hope that I saved a precious original from The Maestro for next generation of harpists.
